# Data Analysis
This map contains all scripts regarding analysing the experimental data.
See the top of each file for a short overview of what the file does.

## Map structure
`bike_models_n_friction/` - Map containing the speed dependent state space matrices of a Carvallo Whipple bicycle model with friction in the steer.

`drift_sim_data/` - Map containing time domain responses obtaind by simulating the bicycle adapted to have a drift. (Can be recreated using the script `../simulations/simulate_drift_data.py`.)

`side_functions/` - Map containing functions that may be useful in the future, are not main functions for the analysis.
