    \caption{Web of connections, giving an overview of how the components of the steer-by-wire bicycle interact with each other. The two main PCBs have a thicker rim. Some interactions are not drawn to keep the overview clean (e.g. the microcotroller can read out the motor encoders that are relayed via the power PCB to the extension PCB to the microcontroller). However, the main interactions are drawn.}

\subsection{Instrumentation Amplifier Prototype Board}
Taken from \href{https://github.com/mechmotum/TUDelft-SbW-Bicycle/tree/master/docs}{Simonas Draukas's} documentation and adapted to the current state of the bicycle.
For the instrumental amplifier to amplify both positive \textit{and} negative values coming from the force transducer, I disconnected pin 5 from ground and connected it to pin 4 (and thereby pin 14).
This makes a pseudo-ground as described on page 13 of the INA125 documentation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pins 1 and 2 of both chips are connected to \verb|+5V| (orange wire).
  \item Pins 3, 5 and 12 of the torque sensor chip are connected to \verb|GND| (black wire).
  \item Pins 3 and 12 of the force transducer chip are connected to \verb|GND| (black wire).
  \item Pins 4 and 14 of both chips are connected to a blue wire each.
  \item Pins 6 of both chips are connected to a white wire each.
  \item Pins 7 of both chips are connected to a green wire each.
  \item Pins 8 and 9 of both chips are connected through resistors (47 Ohms for the torque sensor amplifier and 62 Ohms for he force transducer amplifier).
  \item Pins 10 and 11 of both chips are connected together with a wire (yellow labelled \verb|Output torque sensor| for one chip, and purple labelled \verb|Output force transducer| for another)
  \item Two black and a grey wires are connected to \verb|GND| as well.
  \item Capacitors are placed between \verb|+5V| and \verb|GND| wires.

\subsection{Micro Controller} \label{sec:pinout_teensy}
For the speed and cadence encoders, I switched the location of the connection junction on the PCB. (So cadence is now on speed and vice versa.)
This means that the cadence encoder previously connected to J3, is now mounted as wheel encoder and connected to J5 going to pin 2 and 3 of the teensy. 
The former wheel encoder, was connected to J5, and is now connected to J3.
