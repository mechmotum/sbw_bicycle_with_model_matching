\section{Connections}

The rear electronics box contains two PCBs and a microcontroller. Originally, Teensy 3.6 was used, however, it is a discontinued model. Therefore, the controller was upgraded to a Teensy 4.1. One of the PCBs, from now on referred to as "Power board", is housing the two Maxon ESCON 50/5 motor drives and converts the battery's voltage of 37V to other required voltages. The other PCB interfaces with the microcontroller and is referred to as "MC board".

Table \ref{tab:teensy_mc} lists the connections between Teensy and MC board. Table \ref{tab:mc_power} lists the connections between MC and Power boards.

\section{Teensy}

\subsection{Teensy 3.6}
The bicycle originally featured a Teensy 3.6 installed at the very back of the electronics box. This Teensy contains the code necessary to control the handlebars and the fork. It runs a PD controller implemented by Georgios Dialynas, which runs at 1000 Hz and makes the handlebar angle follow the fork angle, and vice-versa. The code can be found on \href{https://github.com/gdialynas/Steer-by-wire-bicycle}{GitHub/gdialynas/Steer-by-wire-bicycle}.

\subsection{Teensy 4.1}
Teensy 3.6 has been discontinued and is out of stock (as of April 2022). Therefore, in order to ensure the longevity of the bicycle, it was decided to move to Teensy 4.1, as it is going to be significantly easier to obtain spare microcontrollers in the event of Teensy getting damaged.

The pinout of the Teensy changed slightly between the versions 3.6 and 4.1. The most impactful change was the location of the Analog pins. For this exact application, this meant that pins 33 and 34 are no longer Analog and the wires need to be redirected to other pins. Pins 40 and 41 were chosen as replacements, respectively.

Starting from here, the documentation assumes that Teensy 4.1 is used.

The updated code for the Teensy is stored at \href{https://github.com/sdrauksas/TUDelft-SbW-Bicycle}{GitHub/sdrauksas/TUDelft-SbW-Bicycle}.


\section{Microcontroller Board}
This is a custom made PCB that was designed by Oliver Lee, Georgios Dialynas, and Andrew Berry. This PCB is used in both the Steer-by-Wire bicycle and the fixed-base Bicycle Simulator. It is designed as an expansion board for the STM32-H405, that features an MPU-9250 IMU, two Ethernet ports, an SD card reader and was designed to be used together with the Power supply board discussed later.

However, now a Teensy is used instead of the STM32-H405, therefore, most of the Teensy's pins are connected to this board to the \verb|EXT1| and \verb|EXT2| headers, where the STM32-H405 would sit.

The PCB schematic can be found in either \href{https://github.com/oliverlee/gyropcb}{GitHub/oliverlee/gyropcb} or its fork \href{https://github.com/gdialynas/gyropcb}{GitHub/gdialynas/gyropcb} under the name \verb|mc_pcb|.

\subsection{Board's Pinout}
This board features two 26-pin headers \verb|EXT1| and \verb|EXT2| in the middle of the board. These headers were made for the \href{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/}{OLIMEX STM32-H405}\footnote{\href{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/}{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/}} microcontroller. There are also seven 2-pin headers (from \verb|J10| to \verb|J16|), three 4-pin headers (\verb|J3, J4, J5|), two 6-pin headers (\verb|J8, J9|), and two 8-pin headers (\verb|J6, J7|) along the sides of the board. For the Steer-by-Wire application, four more wires are soldered to the pads on the PCB in the location, where a \verb|U4| IC chip should be soldered.

The \verb|EXT1| and \verb|EXT2| header pins are numbered according to \href{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/resources/STM32-H405_UM.pdf}{OLIMEX User Guide, page 9}\footnote{\href{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/resources/STM32-H405_UM.pdf}{https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-H405/resources/STM32-H405\_UM.pdf}}).

Headers are connected according to Tables \ref{tab:teensy_mc} and \ref{tab:mc_power}.


\section{Power Board}
This is a custom made PCB that was designed by Oliver Lee, Georgios Dialynas, and Andrew Berry. This PCB is used in both the Steer-by-Wire bicycle and the fixed-base Bicycle Simulator. It is a power supply board that interfaces with two \href{https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/438725}{Maxon ESCON 50/5}\footnote{\href{https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/438725}{https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/438725}} servo controller modules.

The PCB schematic can be found in either \href{https://github.com/oliverlee/gyropcb}{GitHub/oliverlee/gyropcb} or its fork \href{https://github.com/gdialynas/gyropcb}{GitHub/gdialynas/gyropcb} under the name \verb|power_pcb|.

\subsection{Board's Pinout}
In the middle of the board, there are two 18-pin headers \verb|EXT1| and \verb|EXT3|, and two 11-pin headers \verb|EXT2| and \verb|EXT4|. These headers are used to seat the ESCON modules. There are also four 2-pin headers (\verb|J10|, \verb|J11|, \verb|J12|, \verb|J16|), one 5-pin header (\verb|J5|), two 6-pin headers (\verb|J2|, \verb|J4|), and four 8-pin headers (\verb|J1|, \verb|J3|, \verb|J6|, \verb|J7|) along the sides of the board. There are also two 4-pin headers glued on the bottom side of the board.

Headers \verb|EXT1| and \verb|EXT2| are used to seat the handlebar motor's ESCON module.

Headers \verb|EXT3| and \verb|EXT4| are used to seat the fork motor's ESCON module.

Other headers are connected according to Table \ref{tab:mc_power}.

\section{Protoboard}
There is a protoboard containing two IC chips, 2 capacitors and a couple of resistors. The two ICs are \href{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina125.pdf}{INA125P}\footnote{\href{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina125.pdf}{https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina125.pdf}} amplifiers. The analog torque sensor and force transducer go through these amplifiers. Each chip has 16 pins.

These are the connections:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Pins 1 and 2 of both chips are connected to \verb|+5V| (orange wire).
  \item Pins 3, 5 and 12 of both chips are connected to \verb|GND| (black wire).
  \item Pins 4 and 14 of both chips are connected to a blue wire each.
  \item Pins 6 of both chips are connected to a white wire each.
  \item Pins 7 of both chips are connected to a green wire each.
  \item Pins 8 and 9 of both chips are connected through resistors (47 Ohms for the torque sensor amplifier and 62 Ohms for he force transducer amplifier).
  \item Pins 10 and 11 of both chips are connected together with a wire (yellow labelled \verb|Output torque sensor| for one chip, and purple labelled \verb|Output force transducer| for another)
  \item Two black and a grey wires are connected to \verb|GND| as well.
  \item Capacitors are placed between \verb|+5V| and \verb|GND| wires.
\end{itemize}
