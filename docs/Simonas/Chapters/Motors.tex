\section{Front assembly}
Front assembly consists of two \href{https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/category/motor?etcc_cu=onsite&etcc_med_onsite=Product&etcc_cmp_onsite=EC+flat+Program&etcc_plc=Overview-Page-Brushless-DC-Motors&etcc_var=%5bcom%5d%23en%23_d_&target=filter&filterCategory=ecflat}{Maxon EC45 Flat} brushless DC motors. The motors have hall sensors and encoders. Power is unknown.

The motors are equipped with Maxon GP42C planetary gearheads.

The 8-pin connector has this pin-out (according to \footnote{\href{https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys_master/root/8882563055646/EN-21-297.pdf}{https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys\_master/root/8882563055646/EN-21-297.pdf}} and \footnote{\href{https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys_master/root/8882567512094/EN-21-310.pdf}{https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys\_master/root/8882567512094/EN-21-310.pdf}}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pin 1 -- Hall sensor 1
  \item Pin 2 -- Hall sensor 2
  \item Pin 3 -- \verb|+5V|
  \item Pin 4 -- Motor winding 3
  \item Pin 5 -- Hall sensor 3
  \item Pin 6 -- \verb|GND|
  \item Pin 7 -- Motor winding 1
  \item Pin 8 -- Motor winding 2
\end{itemize}

\section{Rear wheel}
The rear wheel is driven by a brushless \href{https://www.goldenmotor.com/magicpie/magicpie.html}{"Magic Pie"}\footnote{\href{https://www.goldenmotor.com/magicpie/magicpie.html}{https://www.goldenmotor.com/magicpie/magicpie.html}} hub motor manufactured by "Golden Motor". It is a 36V model, but not sure what power output.

The hub motor is controlled using a twist throttle and has cruise-control. Cruise control is (de-)activated using the red button above the green button with a horn logo. Pulling the brakes deactivates the cruise-control as well. The cruise-control does not account for wind or slopes, all it does is keep the same current in the motor.

The hub motor also features regenerative braking.

The motor can be easily disabled by unplugging 4 cables at the front of the bicycle. Cables are labelled A-D. Cable A carries cruise-control's commands, cable B - front brake lever's, cable C - throttle's, and cable D - rear brake lever's. Cables A and C can only be plugged in to their respective plugs, while B and D can be plugged in to either.
