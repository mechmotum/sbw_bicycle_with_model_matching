Teensy 4.1  --- BT Module
Pin 0 (RX1) <-> TXD
Pin 1 (TX1) <-> RXD
GND         <-> GND
VIN (5V)*    <-> VCC 

*While the VIN is supposed to be used as power IN, here we are using it as
power OUT to the BT module. Since VUSB and VIN are connected, 5V are coming
through USB and BT module siphons off some current from the USB. It should be
fine as long as BT module current is low
