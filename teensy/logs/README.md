The logs are used in multiple python scripts. But most logs here are outdated. To see which logs are still used search for .log in the python scripts (folders 'simulations', 'data_analysis', and 'sensitivity analysis'). You can most likely remove the rest. (I did not bother with it, as this documentation proces is already taking longer than I would like)
